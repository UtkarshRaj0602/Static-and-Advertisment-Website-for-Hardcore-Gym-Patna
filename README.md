# Static-and-Advertisment-Website-for-Hardcore-Gym-Patna
Developed a static and responsive web application for a gym named Hardcore Gym, Patna, Bihar and hosted it on github for testing purpose. The web app has all the details of the gym, what they do, what their working hours are, where to find them, their contact information, as well as link to their social media handles such as whatsapp and facebook. 


Challenges covered: 

1. The CSS was a bit tough to design and code. Did a lot of research and browsing in order to get exact design i was looking for. 

Tools used: Html, CSS, JavaScript and GIT. 


My role was to design the whole UI of the web app, write the whole code and also to in tegrate with the needs and demands of the employer.
